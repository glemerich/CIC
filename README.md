Project Description:
Currently In Congress (CIC) is a discussion board website that aims to provide current information to the general public regarding the day-to-day proceedings of the current (117th) sitting U.S. Congress. Our goal is to combat misinformation in the 21st-century news landscape by offering transparent and unbiased coverage. Our website will provide updates to ongoing proceedings in Congress and allow for users to comment on and discuss this information. Additionally, users can find general information regarding Congressmen and their bill voting records. We also facilitate direct interaction between users and Congressmen, allowing Congressmen to respond to comments and post voting polls to gauge public opinion about their decisions. As we approach an important general election year, we believe this project is particularly relevant and essential for fostering informed civic participation.
